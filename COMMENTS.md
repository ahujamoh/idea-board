### My genuine Confessions

1.  I did not write Unit Test Cases because I am learning it now. None of my hitherto organizations demanded it. I will learning and writing them ASAP now on.
2.  I have not worked on styling (CSS) and HTML since almost last 2 years because in my current organization there is a separate team for that. I realized I need to brush-up my HTML-CSS knowledge.

### What is achieved

1. With the aim of making the application fully configurable via just one file, I have made many things configurable. For example Categories and Priorities.
2. Though I have not worked on CSS for almost 2 years now, I could achieve a decent amount of styling.
3. Finished the task (React + HTML + CSS) in almost 6 hours including README.md and COMMENTS.md.

### What is NOT achieved

1. I could not make it 100% configurable due to time constraint.
2. No CSS Pre-processors were used because its bundling configuration was taking a lot of time. Given time, I could make styling more professional.
3. **Could not write UNIT TEST CASES**
4. the **STRETCH PART** was not completed.

###Thank You.
